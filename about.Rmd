My name is Leandra Bryant (she/her/hers) and I am a Junior at the University of New Hampshire pursuing a dual degree in Biomedical Science: Medical Microbiology and French. I have a background in science, healthcare, and education. I was involved in the UNH COVID logistics team on campus and currently works as a laboratory assistant at Portsmouth Regional Hospital. My interests include volunteering as an EMT and mentoring my peers in science courses. I am focused on epidemiology and disease in humans and animals and plan to attend graduate school. Originally from Atlanta, Georgia, I enjoy hanging at the beach, listening to music, and painting in my free time.
